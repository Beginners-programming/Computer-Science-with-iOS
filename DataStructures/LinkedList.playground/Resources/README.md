## What is a Linked List

A linked list is a data structure to store data and access data in an orderly manner.

**Key ingredients of linked lists:**

- `node`: a data representation that will be stored in the linked list.

**Some key properties of linked lists are**:

- `head` : the first element in the linked list.
- `tail` : the last element in the linked list.

**Some key functionalities of linked lists are**:

- `append`: adding element to the back of the linked list.
- `prepend`: adding element to the start of the linked list.
- `insertAt`: inserting an element at the given index.
- `remove`: removing the last element.
- `removeAt`: removing an element at the given index.
- `retrieveAt`: retrieving the element at the given index.

**Additional functionality**:

- `pretty print`: readable representation of the elements in the linked list orderly.
- `replaceAt`: replace an element at the index of the linked list.
- `count`: number of elements in total stored in the linked list.
