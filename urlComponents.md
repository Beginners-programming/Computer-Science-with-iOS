# URL Components

`URLComponents` is a struct that parses and contructs URLs from their smaller parts

An advantage of `URLComponents` over `URL` is that when inspecting the URL on a URLComponent, you can inspect the query and query items, unlike URL where you can't.

URL components in Swift are comprised of
- scheme
- host
- path
- URLQueryItems
