# Types

Swift has two types; named types and compound types.

### **Names types**

Defined by the given name e.g. *class*, *struct*, *enum*, *protocol*

### **Compound types**

Defined by the signature that identify them as types e.g. *function*, *tuple*

The signature of a function is from its parameters and type it returns.

To visualize it better, look at this function as an example

```swift
func fullName(first: String, Last: String) -> String { ... }
```

It's raw type information being `(String, String) -> String`, translating to it's function type or signature. This is used by the Swift compiler to know the type/signature of the function
